3. OUR MODEL (The Methodology)

    Design Concept: 2x2 Grid (The "Engine").

    Intro: "We don't do classrooms. We do product sprints. A rigorous four-stage framework to turn ideas into assets."

    Selection (Scouting the Bold): We identify high-potential founders with unique insights. We don't fund business plans; we fund obsession and grit.

    The Sprint (Build & Break): Rapid prototyping. We transform concepts into MVPs with robust architecture. If it doesn't work, we kill it fast. If it works, we double down.

    The Launch (Market Reality): Governance from Day 1. We structure the venture, handle the legal compliance, and push the product to real users.

    Scale (Global Reach): Preparing the startup for national expansion and export readiness. We connect founders to the capital needed to grow.

    For too long, we have exported labor. It is time to export innovation.

    YetiNova is the engine for Nepal’s brightest young minds. We bridge the gap between raw ambition and global capital. We back export-ready startups in AI and Green Energy, and reinvest our wins into R&D—ensuring the cycle continues for the next generation.

B. Our DNA (Core Values Grid)

    Builders First: We put young makers in the lead. We learn by shipping real products, not theory.
